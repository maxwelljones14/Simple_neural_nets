# Simple_neural_nets
a simple neural net implementation for instructive purposes

neural nets by hand, makes a neural net with 2 input nodes, a hidden layer with 8 hidden nodes and a bias, and an output
node which outputs <1 if the 2 inputs represent a point inside the unit circle and >1 if it represents a point outside the unit circle.
When running the code, it prints the percent correct, and the data structure that stores the network (a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
represents a layer of weights)
